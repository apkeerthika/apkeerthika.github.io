						<p><strong>TITLE: MOBILE APP FOR SAFETY DRIVING USING 3AXIS ACCELEROMETER</strong></p>
						<p> We can use the three-axis accelerometer of an Android-based smart phone to record and analyze various driver behaviors and external road conditions that could potentially be hazardous to the health of the driver, the neighboring public, and the automobile. Effective use of these data can educate a potentially dangerous driver on how to safely and efficiently operate a vehicle. With real-time analysis and auditory alerts of these factors, we can increase a driver’s overall awareness to maximize safety.</p>
						<p><strong>TITLE: BALANCED EQUI DISTANCE CLUSTER BASED  PARTICLE  SWARM OPTIMIZATION IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS</strong></p>
						 <p>Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can be defined as a self-configured networks to monitor physical or environmental conditions and pass their data through the network. Energy is one of the most important resources in such networks. The  Enhanced Optimized Energy Efficient Routing protocol (E-OEERP) eliminates such individual node formation and improves the overall network lifetime. The E-OEERP shows better performance in terms of energy efficiency is much reduced, throughput, transmission delay is reduced and network life time is prolonged of the nodes.</p>
